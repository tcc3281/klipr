    Decoding thumbnails allocates and frees large buffers in a burst. glibc
    keeps that freed space on its own heap rather than returning it, so RSS
    stays at the peak long after the memory is dead — measured 119MB held
    where only ~104MB was live, and it takes glibc hours to give back on its
    own. Python's gc has nothing to do with this (gc.collect() moved RSS by
    0.0MB); it is entirely below the interpreter, so malloc_trim is the only
    thing that releases it.

    Cheap and safe: it only returns memory already free, never anything in
    use. Not available outside glibc (musl, for instance), hence the guard —
    a system without it just keeps the old behaviour.
